Game-Playing-agent: i have created a game-solving agent for the above game which is trained on 50+ testcases to play the game which maximisises the wining probabilty.i have created different utility functions to                        take descions.
                    the agent uses different kinds of heuristics which analysis the game at each frame and tacke quick and efficent decisions to deffend the lawn.
